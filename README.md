Here’s a step-by-step breakdown to help you establish your Instagram account for faceless edits in affiliate marketing:
________________________________________
1. Choosing a Unique Instagram Account Name
Creating a catchy name that’s memorable and indicates your niche can help attract the right followers. Here are some suggestions:
•	EditEssentials – A clean, easy-to-remember name suggesting curated product essentials.
•	CleverFindsDaily – A name that implies daily or regular content and product discoveries.
•	TrendSwipe – Catchy and feels modern, suggesting trending products.
•	EditEdge – Simple, versatile, with "edge" indicating cool or popular products.
•	AffiliDaze – Implies a "dazed" effect from scrolling through desirable items, with a playful twist on "affiliate."
2. Instagram Bio
A short bio that communicates what you do and includes a call-to-action (CTA) can be very effective. Here are some example bios:
•	EditEssentials
“Daily finds to elevate your style, home & more! 💫 Curated picks you’ll love, without the clutter. ⬇️ Shop our featured links!”
•	CleverFindsDaily
“Products that speak to your vibe. 🛍️ Swipe up for effortless style and top recommendations. Link below for all favorites ⬇️.”
•	TrendSwipe
“Swipe for the latest and greatest! 🤳 Faceless edits, curated finds & more. Ready to level up? 💥 Shop now ⬇️.”
Link in bio: Use Linktree (or a similar link aggregator) to compile affiliate links in one place, making it easy for followers to access all your product links. Linktree (or alternatives like Beacons or Carrd) allows you to customize the link and brand it to suit your account's aesthetic.
3. Links to Products
Sign up for affiliate programs on platforms like Amazon Associates, RewardStyle, ShareASale, or CJ Affiliate. Once registered, create and organize your product links. Group your products by category (e.g., Fashion, Home Decor, Tech), and link to your Linktree in the bio. Update your link list weekly or bi-weekly, depending on the products you feature.
For example:
•	Amazon Products – Link to your top recommended products, updated weekly.
•	Special Deals – Seasonal items, flash sales, etc.
•	Top 5 Favorites of the Month – Update this section regularly to keep followers engaged.
4. Posting Schedule for the Next Month
A consistent posting schedule is crucial for engagement. Plan for at least 4-5 posts per week. Here’s an example for the next 4 weeks:
Week 1:
•	Day 1 (Monday): “Start your week with essentials” – Fashion products (clothes, accessories).
•	Day 2 (Wednesday): “Midweek Motivation” – Home decor and productivity-related items.
•	Day 3 (Friday): “Weekend Finds” – Electronics, tech accessories.
•	Day 4 (Sunday): “Sunday Must-Haves” – Wellness or self-care products.
Week 2:
•	Day 1 (Monday): “New Arrivals” – Curated finds across categories.
•	Day 2 (Wednesday): “Fashion Forward” – Highlight trending fashion items.
•	Day 3 (Friday): “Kitchen Essentials” – Useful gadgets for the home.
•	Day 4 (Sunday): “Beauty Basics” – Skincare and makeup tools.
Week 3:
•	Day 1 (Monday): “Best of Amazon Finds” – Mixed selection of trending Amazon products.
•	Day 2 (Wednesday): “Wellness Wednesday” – Health, fitness, and wellness items.
•	Day 3 (Friday): “Friday Faves” – Highlight products that got the most engagement.
•	Day 4 (Sunday): “Sunday Reset” – Relaxation and self-care items.
Week 4:
•	Day 1 (Monday): “Under $50 Finds” – Budget-friendly items.
•	Day 2 (Wednesday): “Weekly Rewind” – Recap of popular posts/products.
•	Day 3 (Friday): “Special Deals Alert” – Limited-time deals.
•	Day 4 (Sunday): “Top Picks of the Month” – Round-up of the month’s best items.
